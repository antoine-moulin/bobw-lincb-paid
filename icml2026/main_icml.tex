\begin{abstract}
  We study the problem of linear contextual bandits with paid observations, where at each round the learner selects an action in order to minimize its loss in a given context, and can then decide to pay a fixed cost to observe the loss of any arm. Building on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework with efficient estimators via Matrix Geometric Resampling, we introduce a computationally efficient Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) algorithm for this problem. We show that it achieves the minimax-optimal regret of $\Theta(T^{2/3})$ in adversarial settings, while guaranteeing poly-logarithmic regret in (corrupted) stochastic regimes. Our approach builds on the framework from \cite{BOBWhardproblems} to design BOBW algorithms for ``hard problem'', using analysis techniques tailored for the setting that we consider. %, which may be of independent interest.

% \textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of the paper
% submitted for blind review.

% If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and usually should)
% include acknowledgements.  Such acknowledgements should be placed at the end of
% the section, in an unnumbered section that does not count towards the paper
% page limit. Typically, this will include thanks to reviewers who gave useful
% comments, to colleagues who contributed to the ideas, and to funding agencies
% and corporate sponsors that provided financial support.

\section*{Impact Statement}

This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine
Learning. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none
which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.

% In the unusual situation where you want a paper to appear in the
% references without citing it in the main text, use \nocite

\section{Comments Dorian}
\DB{Updated!}

Comments after visit in Oxford, Feb 26:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We managed to move forward with the ghost sample trick.
    \item To get the desired bound on the stability term we had to redefine all quantities in an average (over context) sense. 
    \item It seems that we could at least get the $T^{2/3}$ bound this way. Not clear about the stochastic bound
	\item Having context-dependent observation probabilities seem quite hard. We would need to finely examine the smoothness of this prob. This might be an interesting direction, but what assumptions are needed for this? 
\end{itemize}

To-DO:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Check the Bobw properties with the averaged parametrization
	\item If we can only get the $T^{2/3}$, benchmark with what a simpler adaptation of Exp3 + simpler time-dependent learning rate/exploration prob would get. 	
\end{itemize}

Questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item It is not clear that we can relax the assumption that $\Delta_{\min}>0$ (even to "just" get the $T^{2/3}$). Doing so even in Yuko's setting might be interesting. It would be interesting to further refine what it can mean to be BOBW in a continuous contexts setting, maybe it might be cool to check the papers on Greedy to see if there are nice insights.
	\item Related: taking Kuroki's setting and use the stability/penalty matching framework of Taira with Tsallis entropy might be nice, and maybe we can get improved results. 
	\item Not clear what the lower bound should be (even in the full-info/no cost case), might be interesting too. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Kuroki et al. have a worst stochastic bound in $(\log(T))^3+d(\log(T))^2$. Seems to be because how the exploration parameter should both be large enough for the MGR bias and at the same time depend tightly on the learning rate.
\end{itemize}
