\begin{abstract}
  We study the problem of linear contextual bandits with paid observations, where at each round the learner selects an action in order to minimize its loss in a given context, and can then decide to pay a fixed cost to observe the loss of any arm. Building on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework with efficient estimators via Matrix Geometric Resampling, we introduce a computationally efficient Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) algorithm for this problem. We show that it achieves the minimax-optimal regret of $\Theta(T^{2/3})$ in adversarial settings, while guaranteeing poly-logarithmic regret in (corrupted) stochastic regimes. Our approach builds on the framework from \cite{BOBWhardproblems} to design BOBW algorithms for ``hard problem'', using analysis techniques tailored for the setting that we consider. %, which may be of independent interest.

% \textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of the paper
% submitted for blind review.

% If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and usually should)
% include acknowledgements.  Such acknowledgements should be placed at the end of
% the section, in an unnumbered section that does not count towards the paper
% page limit. Typically, this will include thanks to reviewers who gave useful
% comments, to colleagues who contributed to the ideas, and to funding agencies
% and corporate sponsors that provided financial support.

\section*{Impact Statement}

This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine
Learning. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none
which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.

% In the unusual situation where you want a paper to appear in the
% references without citing it in the main text, use \nocite

\section{To-Do Dorian}

\begin{itemize}
    \item We have to cleanly re-write the proof with the ghost sample technique, which is probably going to simplify some things (\eg, Lemma 6, maybe the property is only needed for the ghost context). To do that, work directly from Lemma 3 of \citet{NeuO20}. We will probably be able to get the dimension from the standard trace trick.
    \item In Eq.~\eqref{eq::bad_conditioning}, if we want to use Lemma 2 we have to upper bounds the probabilities by $1$ and get $K$ instead of $\sum q_a^{2-\alpha}$. Otherwise, we need a bound on $\bbE \sbr*{q_{t, a}^{2 - \alpha} \widehat \ell_{t, a}^2}$ directly. 
    \item In the MGR concentration and the proof of Lemma 2 we wrongly do as if the observation probability was uniform across all arms, the only way to make it right seems to use $\min_{x \in \cX}p_t \spr*{x}$. Several errors of this type can be corrected by introducing a forced exploration.
\end{itemize}

In addition, below are some things that I don't understand and some remarks
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item In those papers they also use what is our Lemma 2 on the MGR-induced losses directly, not on the ``unbiased estimates losses''.
    \item I really want to understand what ``should'' be the right dependency in $d$, if not from a formal lower bound at least from an intuitive point of view.
    \item Kuroki et al. have a worst stochastic bound in $(\log(T))^3+d(\log(T))^2$. I'm wondering why and if we should have the same or if Taira's framework prevents us from that.
\end{itemize}
